                Forests cover 31% of the land area on our planet. They produce vital oxygen and provide homes for people and wildlife. 
                Many of the world’s most threatened and endangered animals live in forests, and 1.6 billion people rely on benefits forests offer, including food, fresh water, clothing, traditional medicine and shelter. 
                But forests are under threat from deforestation, agriculture, mining and climate change. They are also at risk from unsustainable management and illegal logging. 
                Urgent action must be taken to help conserve and sustainably use the world’s forests.

                            Forests are the most biologically-diverse ecosystems on land, home to more than 80% of the terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. 
                            They also provide shelter, jobs and security for forest-dependent communities. 
                            They play a key role in the fight against climate change. 
                            They help to regulate the climate and support the lives of many species.<br><br>

                            Forests play a vital role in ensuring the availability of pure water through several mechanisms. 
                            They serve as biological filters, removing contaminants and pollutants as water seeps into the soil. Forest assist in ensuring a stable water supply, 
                            reducing flooding, and maintaining steady water flow by controlling the hydrological cycle. Additionally, the shade provided by their cover helps to support aquatic ecosystems by regulating water temperatures. 
                            Maintaining pure, clean water availability for downstream human and environmental requirements depends on protecting forests.<br><br>

                        <p class="intro">
                            Deforestation, illegal logging, forest degradation, climate change, invasive species, and habitat fragmentation are some of the threats facing forests. 
                            These threats result in reduced ecosystem services, ecosystem disruption, and biodiversity loss. 
                            Protected area creation, sustainable forest management, law enforcement against illegal activities, community engagement, 
                            international cooperation, and implementing climate change adaptation strategies are all part of conservation initiatives. 
                            We can sustain the vital services that forests give to humanity and the environment, protect forests, and preserve biodiversity by tackling these challenges with comprehensive conservation measures.

                        <p class="intro">
                            Forest restoration is the process of regenerating native forests that have been degraded, damaged or destroyed. 
                            The main goal is to restore the ecological integrity of the forest, while also providing economic, social and cultural benefits. 
                            Forest restoration can be achieved through natural regeneration, planting or seeding. 
                            International initiatives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 15 (Life on Land), 
                            aim to promote the sustainable management and conservation of forests and halt deforestation and biodiversity loss.

            <p class="title_intro">
                Mountains are home to 15% of the world’s population and host about half of the world's biodiversity hotspots. 
                They provide fresh water for everyday life to half of humanity. 
                Their conservation is a key factor for sustainable development and is essential for the survival of millions of people. 
                The impact of climate change, deforestation, and land degradation are all exacerbated in mountainous regions. 
                The United Nations has designated 11 December as International Mountain Day. 
                This day is an opportunity to create awareness about the importance of mountains to life, to highlight the opportunities and constraints in mountain development and to build partnerships that will bring positive change to the world’s mountains and highlands.

                            As outlined under Sustainable Development Goal 15, threats to mountain ecosystems include climate change, deforestation, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity and quality issues, land use conflicts, and natural disasters. 
                            These problems put human health and the ecosystem in danger, so integrated conservation and sustainable management methods are required. To combat these challenges and save biodiversity, maintain mountain ecosystems, guarantee water security, 
                            and advance sustainable development in these areas, it is necessary to increase public awareness, improve institutional capacity, and encourage international collaboration.<br><br>
